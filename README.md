# Task Management Application

## Overview
Tassc is a task management application designed to help users organize and track their tasks effectively. The project involves front-end and back-end development, database design, and integration of these components to provide a seamless user experience.

---

## Project Responsibilities

### 1. Front-End Development
**Technology Stack**: ReactJS (optionally using Next.js for server-side rendering)

#### User Interface Design:
- Design a clean, user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
- Implement features such as:
  - Task creation
  - Task viewing
  - Task editing
  - Task deletion
- Provide a dashboard view to display tasks in various states (e.g., to-do, in-progress, completed).

#### Components:
- **Task List Component**: Display a list of tasks with options to filter and sort.
- **Task Detail Component**: Show details of a selected task, including options to edit and delete.
- **User Authentication Components**: Implement login, registration, and user profile management.

#### Responsive Design:
- Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.

---

### 2. Back-End Development
**Technology Stack**: Node.js and Express.js

#### API Development:
- **User Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **Task Management**: Develop RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

#### Routes and Controllers:
- Define routes for user operations (e.g., register, login, profile management).
- Define routes for task operations (e.g., CRUD operations for tasks).

#### Middleware:
- Implement middleware for authentication, error handling, and validation.

---

### 3. Database Design
**Technology Stack**: MongoDB

#### Schema Design:
- **User Schema**: Define a schema to store user profiles, including authentication details and user preferences.
- **Task Schema**: Design a schema to store task details, including title, description, status, and timestamps.

#### Relationships:
- Establish relationships between users and tasks to associate tasks with the correct users.

---

### 4. Integration
#### Front-End and Back-End Integration:
- Ensure effective communication between front-end components and back-end APIs.
- Implement error handling and user feedback for API interactions.

#### Authentication Integration:
- Integrate authentication flows between the front-end and back-end, including token management and user sessions.

---

### 5. Best Practices
#### Security:
- Implement HTTPS to secure communication.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., JWT secret keys).
- Sanitize and validate user input to prevent injection attacks.

#### Performance:
- Optimize API responses and front-end performance.
- Implement caching strategies if necessary.

#### User Experience:
- Ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use.
- Provide clear feedback and error messages to users.

#### Code Quality:
- Follow coding standards and best practices.
- Write unit and integration tests to ensure application reliability.
