#Tassc Task Management Application
##Overview
Tassc is a task management application designed to help users organize and track their tasks effectively. The application will include front-end and back-end development, database design, and integration of these components to ensure a seamless user experience.

##Project Responsibilities
###1. Front-End Development
Technology Stack: ReactJS (with NextJS for server-side rendering, if desired)

##User Interface Design:

Design a clean, user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
Implement features such as task creation, viewing, editing, and deletion.
Provide a dashboard view to show tasks in various states (e.g., to-do, in-progress, completed).
Components:

##Task List Component: Display a list of tasks with options to filter and sort.
Task Detail Component: Show details of a selected task, including edit and delete options.
User Authentication Components: Implement login, registration, and user profile management.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
##2. Back-End Development
Technology Stack: NodeJS and ExpressJS

##API Development:
User Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization.
Task Management: Develop RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
Routes and Controllers:
Define routes for user operations (register, login, profile management).
Define routes for task operations (CRUD operations for tasks).
Middleware:
Implement middleware for authentication, error handling, and validation.
##3. Database Design
Technology Stack: MongoDB

##Schema Design:
User Schema: Define a schema to store user profiles, including authentication details and user preferences.
Task Schema: Design a schema to store task details, including title, description, status, and timestamps.
Relationships:
Establish relationships between users and tasks to ensure tasks are associated with the correct users.
##4. Integration
Front-End and Back-End Integration:

Ensure that the front-end components communicate effectively with the back-end APIs.
Implement error handling and user feedback for API interactions.
Authentication Integration:

Integrate authentication flows between the front-end and back-end, including token management and user sessions.
##5. Best Practices
Security:

Implement HTTPS to secure communication.
Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., JWT secret keys).
Sanitize and validate user input to prevent injection attacks.
Performance:

Optimize API responses and front-end performance.
Implement caching strategies if needed.
User Experience:

Ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use.
Provide clear feedback and error messages to users.
Code Quality:

Follow coding standards and best practices.
Write unit and integration tests to ensure application reliability.
Deliverables
Front-End Application:

Source code and assets for the user interface.
Documentation for setting up and running the front end.
##Back-End Application:

Source code and configuration for the server and APIs.
Documentation for API endpoints and how to run the server.
Database Schema:

Schema definitions and sample data.
Instructions for setting up the MongoDB database.
##Integration and Deployment:

Instructions for deploying the application.
Any necessary configuration files and environment variables.
Testing:

Test cases and results for both front-end and back-end components.
Documentation for running tests and any known issues.
